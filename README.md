## Abstract

<div align="justify">

Sri Lanka faces mounting environmental challenges including coral reef bleaching, recurrent flooding, escalating urban heat stress, and deteriorating air quality all deeply interconnected yet largely monitored in isolation. Traditional approaches rely on manual observation and fragmented sensor networks, limiting real-time response and effective cross-domain environmental analysis.

To address these critical gaps, this study presents an integrated AI-powered Environmental Intelligence System designed to proactively monitor and manage key environmental conditions across Sri Lanka. The system combines IoT multi-sensor networks with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to continuously collect, process, and analyze environmental data in real time. It delivers intelligent risk classification, early warnings, and actionable insights through a unified web dashboard, SMS alert mechanisms, and an LLM-powered chatbot interface that supports informed decision-making.

Prototype evaluation confirms high predictive accuracy and reliable real-time performance, demonstrating the system's potential as a scalable and proactive solution for national environmental risk management.

## Research objectives

This project was developed as a **Final Year Research (FYP)** deliverable with the following goals:

1. Develop predictive models for environmental risk assessment
2. Integrate real-time IoT sensor data with AI analytics
3. Provide early warnings for floods, heat waves, and air pollution
4. Support sustainable resource management and policy decisions
5. Improve resilience of urban and coastal ecosystems

---

## System modules

All four modules are **IoT-enabled**: field devices stream sensor readings to the Node.js backend in real time; dashboards, ML services, and alert workflows consume that data for monitoring, prediction, and notifications.

| Module | IoT sensors & devices | Key capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coral Reef Health Monitoring Module** | pH, turbidity, and water-temperature probes (inland river monitoring) | EfficientNet-B0 coral bleaching classification, live water-quality fusion, role-based AI guidance |
| **Air Quality Monitoring & Health Advisory Module** | MQ-7, MQ-135, ENS160, DHT11 (CO, CO₂, NH₃, PM2.5, temperature/humidity) | Real-time pollution dashboards, health advisories, OTP-based alert subscriptions |
| **Flood Risk Monitoring & Alert Module** | Ultrasonic water-level sensors and ESP32-based float sensors | Live level tracking, WebSocket updates, threshold-based SMS alerts |
| **Urban Heat Risk Prediction & Alert Module** | IoT temperature/humidity nodes (heat-index and risk-level reporting) | LightGBM multi-step forecasting, weather API enrichment, heat warnings and SMS alerts |

---

## IoT integration

EcoGuard-AI is built around a **shared IoT data pipeline** used by every research module:

```text
IoT devices (ESP32 / sensor nodes)
        ↓  HTTP POST / live ingest
Node.js backend (Express + PostgreSQL)
        ↓  REST API + WebSocket
Next.js dashboards, ML services, SMS & chatbot alerts
```

| Module | Data ingested from IoT | Backend endpoints (examples) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coral Reef Health Monitoring Module | pH, turbidity, water temperature | `/api/water-quality/*` |
| Air Quality Monitoring & Health Advisory Module | CO, CO₂, NH₃, dust/PM, ambient conditions | `/api/air/*`, `/api/pollution` |
| Flood Risk Monitoring & Alert Module | Water level (ultrasonic), float status (ESP32) | `/api/flood`, `/api/float` |
| Urban Heat Risk Prediction & Alert Module | Temperature, humidity, computed heat index | `/api/sensors` |

Live flood and float updates are pushed to the frontend via **WebSocket**; other modules refresh through REST polling and cached prediction jobs.

CREATE DATABASE ecoguard;
```

### 3. Backend

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

Create `Backend/.env` (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)), then start:

```bash

## Machine learning components

### Urban Heat Risk Prediction & Alert Module (`python_api_heat_risk`)

- **Approach:** Direct multi-step forecasting with LightGBM models per horizon and weather variable (temperature, humidity, solar radiation).
- **Data:** Historical and live-updated weather CSV (`data/Weather_*.csv`), refreshed via scheduled weather API updates.
- **Output:** Heat-index style risk levels consumed by the Node.js backend and heat dashboards.

### Coral Reef Health Monitoring Module (`python_api`)

- **Model:** EfficientNet-B0 fine-tuned for three classes:
  - `healthy_corals`
  - `bleach_11_50` (11–50% bleaching)
  - `bleach_50_100` (50–100% bleaching)
- **Context:** Inland river pH, turbidity, and temperature are combined with image inference to explain inland-to-reef pollution pathways (research focus: Sri Lankan coastal ecosystems).
- **Guidance:** OpenAI-powered, role-specific recommendations (researcher, tourism guide, marine authority, general public).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Backend cannot connect to DB | `Backend/.env` credentials; PostgreSQL service running |
| Heat predictions fail | `python_api_heat_risk` on port **8000**; `.pkl` files in `models/direct_multistep/`; weather CSV present |
| Coral service fails at startup | `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `python_api/.env`; `efficientnetb0_model.pth` in `python_api/` |
| Coral UI cannot reach ML API | Coral service on port **8001** (matches `Coral_an/page.tsx`) |
| CORS errors | Frontend origin `http://localhost:3000` allowed in backend and FastAPI CORS settings |
| Flood live updates missing | Backend WebSocket running; dashboard connected to backend `ws` URL |
