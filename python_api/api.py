3. If coral is bleached but water quality is currently good, explain that bleaching may have been caused by PAST conditions, other stressors (e.g. sedimentation, disease, physical damage), or the bleaching is ongoing and water quality alone does not reverse it.
4. Never say the coral is healthy just because water quality is currently good.
